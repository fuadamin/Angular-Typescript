# Digital Elevation Profile ( Geländeprofil )

So, last semester at HSKA, this [web-application] (https://github.com/enocholumide/Gelaendeprofil_LMZ_HSKA.git) was developed as a course project. It draws digital elevation profile at any cross section drawn by the user on a map. It harmonizies several open source tools and data so it is free to use, copy, distrubute as long as you give credits to the original source.

The project can also serve as a template for further development if you want to integrate Leaflet, Angular, Turf and D3 development tools in your personal project.

## Data and Sources

Google Elevation Services
OSM and Overpass API

## Included development tools

Angular, D3, Leaflet, Turf

# Get it working !

If you want to run the application immediately, you can download the 'dist' folder and run the 'index.html' file on your browser.

# Need more features or any issues ?

In case you are using this application and you need more features, you can easily raise such feature you want, I will attempt to make it happen, if not, perhaps I am busy with school,, work or just sleeping it off.

# Further development ?

1. Clone or download the project
2. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies
3. Replace the customized leaflet-draw.js file from /assets with ./node_modules/leaflet-draw/leaflet-draw.js at the node_modules folder

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
